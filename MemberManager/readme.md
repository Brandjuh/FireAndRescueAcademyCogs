## Automation

### Contribution Monitoring

**How it works:**
1. Runs every 12 hours (twice per day)
2. Checks all MC members' contribution rates
3. Analyzes trend over configured weeks
4. Sends alerts if:
   - Rate drops below threshold (default 5%)
   - Rate drops >2% from previous period
5. Cooldown: 1 week between alerts per member

**Alert includes:**
- Current rate
- Trend (rising/falling/stable)
- Analysis of change
- Linked Discord account
- Historical context

### Role Drift Detection

**Detects:**
- Members with linked MC accounts but missing Discord verified role
- Can auto-restore or alert admins

### Coordinated Departure Detection

**Detects:**
- Members who leave both Discord and MC within 72 hours
- Logs as potential rage quit or coordinated action

- Gets Discord ‚Üî MC ID mappings
- Checks verification status

### With AllianceScraper
- Reads MC member data (name, role, contribution)
- Reads contribution history for trend analysis
- Queries members_current and members_history tables
- **Does not write** to AllianceScraper database

### With Red Modlog
- Listens to `on_modlog_case_create` event
- Auto-creates infractions from:
  - Bans, kicks, mutes, timeouts, warnings
- Links Discord user to MC account if linked
- Stores moderator, reason, duration

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No integrations found" warning
**Problem:** MemberSync or AllianceScraper not loaded.

**Solution:**
```bash
[p]load MemberSync
[p]load AllianceScraper
[p]reload MemberManager
```

### Contribution monitoring not working
**Check:**
1. Is automation enabled? `[p]memberset view`
2. Is AllianceScraper running? `[p]scraperinfo`
3. Is alert channel set? `[p]memberset alertchannel #channel`
4. Check logs: `[p]debug`

### Fuzzy search not finding members
**Common causes:**
- Member not in AllianceScraper database yet (wait for next scrape)
- Typo too severe (try exact MC ID or Discord mention)
- Member left alliance
